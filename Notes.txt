all(), filter(), get() These are called Django ORM QuerySet Methods.

| Method         | Use When                          |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| *all()*      | You need all records              |
| *filter()*   | You expect multiple results       |
| *get()*      | Only ONE result must match        |
| *exclude()*  | You want to remove certain values |
| *order_by()* | You need sorting                  |
| *values()*   | You need specific fields only     |
| *create()*   | Insert new row                    |
| *update()*   | Update multiple rows              |
| *delete()*   | Delete rows                       |
| *count()*    | Count results                     |
| *exists()*   | Just check presence (fastest)     |
| *distinct()* | Remove duplicates                 |


⚡ Extra Powerful Filters You Should Know
startswith
User.objects.filter(username__startswith="Nik")

contains
User.objects.filter(email__contains="gmail")

lt / gt (less than / greater than)
Product.objects.filter(price__gt=500)

in
User.objects.filter(id__in=[1,2,3])


✔ Simple Example (Easy to Understand)

Suppose you have a Student model:

class Student(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    age = models.IntegerField()

Get all students
Student.objects.all()

Get 18+ students
Student.objects.filter(age__gte=18)

Get only one student
Student.objects.get(id=1)

Create student
Student.objects.create(name="Nikhil", age=20)

Update age
Student.objects.filter(name="Nikhil").update(age=21)

Delete
Student.objects.get(id=1).delete()

simple example and explanation of decorators

# The wrapper is simply: A new function that wraps around your original function.

# What is *args? *args = all positional arguments ✔ *args accepts ANY type of positional arguments (numbers, strings, lists, objects… anything)

# What is **kwargs? **kwargs = all keyword arguments **kwargs accepts ANY type of keyword arguments (values can also be anything — numbers, strings, lists, functions) 

def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Before function runs")
        
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        
        print("After function runs")
        return result
    
    return wrapper
@my_decorator
def greet():
    print("Hello!")

greet()

Final Summary

🔹 wrapper
A function inside decorator that adds extra behavior before/after your real function.

🔹 *args
Collects all positional arguments into a tuple.

🔹 **kwargs
Collects all keyword arguments into a dictionary.

🔹 Why used in decorators?
Because a decorator must work on any function, no matter how many arguments it has.
